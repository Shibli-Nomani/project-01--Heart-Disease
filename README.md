# Heart Disease Prediction with Supervised Machine Learning Models(Binary Classification)

ðŸ’– Why Heart Disease Prediction Matters: Early detection of heart disease can save lives by enabling timely interventions and reducing complications. ðŸ§  Why Machine Learning: ML analyzes vast medical data to uncover hidden patterns, improving prediction accuracy. ðŸš€ Impact: It enhances diagnostic efficiency, personalizes treatment, and supports better decision-making in healthcare.

# ðŸ˜‰ About Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shiblinomani/housenodigits

1. Data preprocessing and EDA to prepare the dataset for Heart Disease.
2. Applying SMOTETomek Oversampling. GridSearchCV was performed to find the best hyperparameters for different models in separate notebooks.
3. Applying Logistic Regression, SVM (Linear), SGDClassifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting, XGBOOST and ADABoost with/without hyperparameter tuning.
4. Comparing different model performances based on training accuracy, testing accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and AUC score.
   
# ðŸŽ¢ Summary 
We have created customized model for the Recognizing Street View Housing Number over Gray Image using the SVHN_single_grey1.h5 file. Model accuracy is **95.248% for training and 93.794% for testing**.

By working on with layers/normalization/ image Data Genaration, we can improve the accuracy and drop down the loss.
