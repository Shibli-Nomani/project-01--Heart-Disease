# Heart Disease Prediction with Supervised Machine Learning Models(Binary Classification)

ðŸ’– Why Heart Disease Prediction Matters: Early detection of heart disease can save lives by enabling timely interventions and reducing complications. ðŸ§  Why Machine Learning: ML analyzes vast medical data to uncover hidden patterns, improving prediction accuracy. ðŸš€ Impact: It enhances diagnostic efficiency, personalizes treatment, and supports better decision-making in healthcare.

# ðŸ˜‰ About Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shiblinomani/heart-disease-dataset/data

1. Data preprocessing and EDA to prepare the dataset for Heart Disease.
2. Applying SMOTETomek Oversampling. GridSearchCV was performed to find the best hyperparameters for different models in separate notebooks.
3. Applying Logistic Regression, SVM (Linear), SGDClassifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Gradient Boosting, XGBOOST and ADABoost with/without hyperparameter tuning.
4. Comparing different model performances based on training accuracy, testing accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score and AUC score.
   
# ðŸŽ¢ Summary 
The Heart Disease Prediction models were evaluated on several key metrics, with **RandomForest** delivering the best train accuracy of **99.687%**, test accuracy of 92.075%, and a strong F1 Score of 0.921. **The GradientBoost model demonstrated excellent performance, with a train accuracy of 99.352% and highest test accuracy of 93.201%, alongside an AUC of 98.084% and a 0.932 F1 Score.** DecisionTree also showed strong results with an F1 Score of 0.891. In contrast, models like SVMLinear and Logistic Regression exhibited lower performance across accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC metrics, highlighting the superiority of ensemble methods like RandomForest and GradientBoost for heart disease prediction.
